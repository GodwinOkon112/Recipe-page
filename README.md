## Overview

This project is a solution to the **Recipe Page** challenge from Frontend Mentor.
The goal was to build a clean, responsive recipe layout using semantic HTML and CSS while closely following the provided design.

It focuses on proper document structure, accessibility, and neat content presentation.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the recipe page clearly on different screen sizes
- Read and understand the recipe structure easily
- See nutrition information displayed in a table
- Experience a layout that matches the provided design as closely as possible

## My process

I started by structuring the page using semantic HTML elements such as `<main>`, `<section>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<table>`.
After completing the markup, I styled the layout with CSS, focusing on spacing, typography, and readability.

The project follows a simple and organized class naming structure to make styling easier and more maintainable.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Semantic markup
- Mobile-first approach

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me to:

- Write cleaner and more semantic HTML
- Structure content properly using lists and tables
- Style tables using CSS while keeping only horizontal borders
- Improve spacing and layout consistency
- Better understand how real-world content is organized on the web

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve my CSS layout skills using Flexbox and Grid
- Pay more attention to accessibility (ARIA roles, contrast, landmarks)
- Practice more Frontend Mentor challenges to strengthen consistency
